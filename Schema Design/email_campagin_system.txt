Design Email Campaign Schema
Unsolved
Design a system to be used by various companies to reach out to their connections through automated email campaigns.



System requirements:

1. Companies should be able to add/update connections.

2. Companies should be able to create email campaigns.

3. Each campaign can have multiple email templates to be delivered after a specified duration of time if the connection does not reply to the mail.

4. Companies should be able to stop the campaign for all or some of the connections.

5. Email templates should be reusable (i.e. same template can be a part of different campaigns).



Future Scope:

1. Group connections based on any criteria (Ex: Backend Profile, Frontend Profile, ICPC Qualifier).

2. Group campaigns and templates based on any criteria.



NOTE:

Draw Class diagram and the ER diagram.
Define the PKs for all the tables.
Mention the columns which should be indexed.


Should the clarification asked at the beginning or while designing the schema?
